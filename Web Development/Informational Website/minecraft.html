            <h2>The creator</h2>
            <img src="images/notch.jfif" alt="Markus Persson (Notch)" class="center" id="notch">
            <p  class="mp">Persson's most popular creation is the survival sandbox game Minecraft,
                which was first publicly available on 17 May 2009 and fully released on 18 November
                2011. Persson left his job as a game developer to work on Minecraft full-time until
                completion. In early 2011, Mojang AB sold the one millionth copy of the game, several
                months later their second, and several more their third. Mojang hired several new staff
                members for the Minecraft team, while Persson passed the lead developer role to Jens Bergensten.
                He stopped working on Minecraft after a deal with Microsoft to sell Mojang for $2.5 billion.
                This brought his net worth to US$1.5 billion.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <img src="images/Minecraft.png" alt="Minecraft Logo" class="center">
            <p class="mp">Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break various
                kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds. The gameâ€™s two main modes are Survival
                and Creative. In Survival, players must find their own building supplies and food.
                They also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures. (Creepers and zombies
                are some dangerous ones.) In Creative, players are given supplies and do not
                have to eat to survive. They also can break all kinds of blocks immediately.</p>

                The smartphone and tablet versions offer multi-player options through
