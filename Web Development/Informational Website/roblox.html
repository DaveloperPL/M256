        <h2>The creator</h2>
        <img src="images/david.jfif" alt="David Baszucki" class="center" id="david">
        <p  class="mp">In 2004, Baszucki, along with Erik Cassel – who worked as Baszucki's VP of Engineering for Interactive Physics –
            began working on an early prototype of Roblox under the working title DynaBlocks. It was later renamed Roblox, a portmanteau
            of "robots" and "blocks", in 2005. The website officially launched in 2006. In a June 2016 interview with Forbes, Baszucki
            stated that the idea for Roblox was inspired by the success of his Interactive Physics and Working Model software applications,
            especially among young students. In a December 2016 interview with VentureBeat, Baszucki said, “We believe we’re starting to see a
            network effect. Retention is getting higher as more people come to play with their friends and have a better chance of finding their
            friends.” Baszucki believes that Roblox is ushering in a new “human co-experience” category that will become larger than gaming.
            In a September 2018 interview with Forbes, Baszucki said, "Right when we started, we imagined a new category of people doing things together.
            A category that involved friends, like social networking; a category that involved immersive 3-D, like gaming; a category that involved cool
            content, like a media company; and finally a category that had unlimited creation, like a building toy.” Baszucki owns a roughly 13% stake
            in the Roblox Corporation, the company that owns Roblox, a stake estimated to be worth roughly $4.2 billion. He intends to use donate
            any net proceeds he earns from Roblox's listing on the New York Stock Exchange to philanthropic purposes. In December 2021, a New York
            Times investigation alleged that he and his relatives used a tax break intended for small business investors in order to legally avoid tens
            of millions of dollars in capital gains taxes.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <img src="images/roblox.png" alt="Roblox" class="center">
        <p class="mp">Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation.
            It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and
            Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres
            coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as
            a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it
            being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. Roblox began
            to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19
            pandemic. Roblox is free-to-play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called
            "Robux". As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by
            over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States. Although Roblox has generally received
            positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation, microtransactions, and alleged
            exploitative practices directed to children.</p>
