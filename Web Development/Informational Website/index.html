        <h2>Minecraft</h2>
        <img src="images/Minecraft.png" class="center" alt="Minecraft">
        <p class="mp">Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios.
            The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several
            early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011,
            with Jens "Jeb" Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other
            platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140
            million monthly active users as of 2021. In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D
            world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items,
            and build structures, earthworks and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs,
            as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode,
            in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players
            have unlimited resources and access to flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items,
            and assets. Early versions of the game received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited as one of the
            greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions
            played large roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry,
            computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by
            Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode,
            Minecraft Dungeons, and the mobile game Minecraft Earth.</p>

        <h2>Roblox</h2>
        <img src="images/xp.png" class="center" alt="Roblox" height="25%">
        <p class="mp">Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation.
        It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David
        Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games
        of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was
        relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of
        interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms
        released around the same time. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s,
        and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Roblox is free-to-play,
        with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called "Robux". As of August 2020,
        Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all
        children aged under 16 in the United States. Although Roblox has generally received
        positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation, microtransactions,
        and alleged exploitative practices directed to children.</p>
